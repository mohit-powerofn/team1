This popular story is about a hare , which is known to move quickly and a tortoise, which is known to move slower.

The story began when the hare who has won many races proposed a race with the tortoise. The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him.

The tortoise agreed and the race began.

The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while.

--Gagan
The moral of the story is 'Slow and Steady wins the race'
